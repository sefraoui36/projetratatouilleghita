          <h2>The Making of Vanilla, Banana & Strawberry Millefeuille:</h2>
      
          <p>Layer by delicate layer, this millefeuille was born from a desire for something light yet decadent — a sweet symphony of crisp, cream, and fruit.</p>
      
          <p>We began with the golden puff pastry, baked to perfection until each sheet became crisp, flaky, and butter-kissed. The kitchen echoed with each delicate crack as they cooled on a rack, ready to become the base of something magical.</p>
      
          <p>Then came the <strong>vanilla crème pâtissière</strong> — slow-cooked with fresh vanilla beans until thick and luxurious. Once chilled, it became the silky heart of our dessert.</p>
      
          <p>Fresh <strong>bananas</strong> were sliced thinly, their mellow sweetness balancing the brightness of ripe <strong>strawberries</strong>, cut into heart-shaped slices for a touch of romance.</p>
      
          <p>With steady hands, we layered: pastry, cream, fruit — again and again — until a delicate tower stood. The final touch? A crown of pastry, dusted lightly with <strong>powdered sugar</strong> and a drizzle of <strong>strawberry coulis</strong>.</p>
      
          <p>Each bite? A dream. Crisp pastry that melts on the tongue, cream that comforts, and fruit that sings. The millefeuille — elegant, joyful, unforgettable.</p>
