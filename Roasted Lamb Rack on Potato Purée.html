          <h2>The Preparation of Roasted Lamb Rack:</h2>
          <p>In the quiet of early evening, the kitchen fills with the scent of rosemary and sizzling fat — the lamb rack begins its transformation. Chosen for its marbling and tenderness, each rib is cleaned and trimmed with care.</p>
    
          <p>We season it generously with <strong>sea salt</strong>, <strong>cracked pepper</strong>, and a crushed blend of <strong>rosemary</strong>, <strong>thyme</strong>, and <strong>garlic</strong>. The meat is seared on a hot pan to lock in the flavor, its surface forming a crisp golden crust.</p>
    
          <p>Then into the oven it goes, where it roasts slowly until blushing pink in the center — juicy, rich, and aromatic.</p>
    
          <h2>The Silky Potato Purée:</h2>
          <p>Meanwhile, we prepare the foundation — a velvety <strong>potato purée</strong>. Steamed Yukon Golds are pressed and blended with <strong>warm cream</strong> and <strong>melted butter</strong>, seasoned delicately with salt and a touch of nutmeg.</p>
    
          <p>The result: a smooth, comforting base, rich enough to carry the boldness of the lamb, light enough to melt on the tongue.</p>
    
          <h2>Plating & Savoring:</h2>
          <p>The dish is plated with elegance — the potato purée laid like silk, the lamb placed delicately above it. A drizzle of reduced <strong>red wine jus</strong> finishes the composition.</p>
    
          <p>Each bite is a journey: robust lamb, soft and deep; creamy potato, mellow and grounding; herbs and jus, fragrant and bold. It’s not just a meal — it’s an experience, rich with tradition and indulgence.</p>
