          <h2>The Whimsy of the Honey Citrus Cloud Cake:</h2>
      
          <p>Born from sunlight and sweetness, the Honey Citrus Cloud Cake is a dessert that floats — light, ethereal, and kissed with golden zest.</p>
      
          <p>We began by whipping a delicate <strong>sponge batter</strong>, infused with the bright notes of fresh <strong>lemon</strong> and <strong>orange zest</strong>. Each egg was folded with care, each swirl capturing air — the secret to the cake's lift and tenderness.</p>
      
          <p>Once baked, the sponge was soft as a cloud, golden at the edges, and feather-light. A honey glaze was gently brushed over the top — warm, fragrant, and floral — melting into the sponge with each stroke.</p>
      
          <p>Between each layer, we spread a velvety <strong>citrus cream</strong>, made with whipped mascarpone, honey, and a touch of lemon juice. The balance of sweetness and tang created a melody on the tongue.</p>
      
          <p>To finish, the cake was crowned with fresh <strong>orange slices</strong>, edible flowers, and a dusting of powdered sugar — like sunlight on a spring morning.</p>
      
          <p>Each bite? A sigh. A breeze. A moment of joy. The Honey Citrus Cloud Cake — made not just to be eaten, but to be felt.</p>
